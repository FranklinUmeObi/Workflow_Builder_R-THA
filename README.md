## Decisions

### Core decisions



### Decision log
This section is a running self monologue of the decisions
I made as I worked on teh project capturing how my thoughts changed
as I worked on this solution.

```
- Could setup project in a few ways, As this is a small simple project I dont need SSR (server side rendering) or Next JS or any other heavy duty heavy oiler plate. Vite has fast build times and is supported by most boiler plate ui libraries.
- Speaking of UI libraries I recently used HeroUI for a side project and seemed pretty good. will try it out for this.
- Debating if I want to have pallette be aove or eside the canvas. I think a more fluid experience would be beside.
- Going to use react flow for canvas
